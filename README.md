Implementing JWT authentication in Spring Boot involves several best practices:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for communication to prevent the interception of tokens.

2. **Store Tokens Securely**: If you're storing tokens on the client side, ensure they're stored securely. Local storage is often used, but it's susceptible to XSS attacks. HttpOnly cookies can be a safer alternative.

3. **Handle Token Expiration**: Tokens should have an expiration time to limit the damage if they're compromised. You'll need to handle token renewal when they expire.

4. **Use a Strong Secret Key**: The secret key used to sign the JWT should be strong and kept secure. Don't hardcode it in your application.

5. **Don't Store Sensitive Data in the Payload**: JWT payloads are just base64 encoded, not encrypted, so don't put sensitive data in them.

6. **Handle Errors**: Ensure your application handles JWT errors, such as token expiration or tampering, gracefully.

7. **Use Standard Claims**: Use standard JWT claims like `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `jti` to take advantage of built-in features of JWT libraries.

8. **Use a Well-Maintained Library**: Use a well-maintained library to handle JWT. For Java, libraries like `java-jwt` or `jjwt` can be used.

Here's a basic example of how you might set up JWT authentication in a Spring Boot application:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityJWT extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint unauthorizedHandler;

    @Autowired
    private UserDetailsService userDetailsService;

    @Autowired
    public void configureAuthentication(AuthenticationManagerBuilder authenticationManagerBuilder) throws Exception {
        authenticationManagerBuilder
                .userDetailsService(this.userDetailsService)
                .passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());
    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }

    @Bean
    public JwtAuthenticationTokenFilter authenticationTokenFilterBean() throws Exception {
        return new JwtAuthenticationTokenFilter();
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
        httpSecurity
                .csrf().disable()
                .exceptionHandling().authenticationEntryPoint(unauthorizedHandler).and()
                .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS).and()
                .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/", "/*.html", "/favicon.ico", "/**/*.html", "/**/*.css", "/**/*.js")
                .permitAll()
                .antMatchers("/api/auth/**").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated();

        httpSecurity
                .addFilterBefore(authenticationTokenFilterBean(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);

        httpSecurity.headers().cacheControl();
    }
}
```

This is a basic setup and might need to be adjusted based on your specific needs. For example, you might need to add more antMatchers based on your application's endpoints.
